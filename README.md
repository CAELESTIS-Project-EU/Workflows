# CAELESTIS HPC WORKFLOWS

This repository stores the workflow templates and phases implementations use in the CAELESTIS Project. It is organized as follows:

- WORKFLOWS: This folder stores the workflow templates implemented for different analysis used in the CAELESTIS Project. This workflow templates have generic steps that can be customized with the AutomationML or YAML workflow descriptions.
- PHASES: This folder contains the different implementations of the workflow generic steps. This implementations are Python modules with functions that implement different sampling methods, simulations, post-processing and ML algorithms that can be used in the workflow templates.
- Examples: This folder contains different examples of workflow definitions used in CAELESTIS.
